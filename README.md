# Docker test
Dockerized version of .Net Core / Angular project.

Uses basic .Net Core / Angular template from Visual Studio.
Split front end to be separate from api to it's own port and added CORS configuration.

Added Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files.

I did this to learn Docker and Docker Compose.
